The tree run files from the MrBayes output were to large to be added as a direct supplement to the journal, and also too large for upload in GitHub.

I split each tree run file into parts that are each smaller than 25Mb. In order to get one coherent tree run file, one simply needs to paste these together in the sequence of the numbering system as safe them as a new text file.
