# Irritator_Bayesian_analysis_outputs

This repository is meant as a supplement to the publication A reappraisal of the cranial and mandibular osteology of the spinosaurid 
Irritator challengeri (Dinosauria: Theropoda) by Schade et al. 2023. The files deposited here are the output files from the MrBayes sump
and sumt commands, as well as the log-file of the analysis.

The files recording the trees along the MCMC runs were to large to be uploaded as single files and are thus split into parts. They can be appended
to one another to get a single nexus file containing all tree samples from one run.
